            In this article I will write about the rule that allowed me to save my first <b>10,000$</b> at the age of 22.<br>
            A goal that anyone with a little commitment can achieve, at any age.<br>
            For many it might seem a little money for others a large figure, I think that they are certainly not an arrival point
            but this amount is a first goal that gives some satisfaction, in fact now I am 23 years old and I have passed that threshold,
            but I want to focus on this figure because I see it as the first small goal to reach. 
            In my opinion, the next one is <b>100,000$</b>, but I still have a long way to go to reach that.

            <h2>My Background</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
            Since I was a young boy I have always tried to do some chores to collect some money. My real problem was to save it,
            in fact I always arrived at the end of the month with 0$ in my wallet because of: discos, cocktails, parties and outings.
            Doesn’t metter if I had earned 250$ or 900$, at the end of the month I always restarted from 0$.<br>
            I have always been lucky at a family level, I have never sailed in gold, but my parents have never made me miss anything.
            The real problem, looking back on it now, was just this, if I spent 250$ a month and earned 250$, I had my mother or father
            covering my a*s, so I didn't realize the importance of savings, <b>I didn't have the right motivation to start saving</b>.
            I was able to take off the whims and have fun, the following month I would have regained some money and even if I was
            in trouble, my parents were there to cover my a*s.

          <h2>The turning point</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "image_chapter_left" id = "tourning"></div>
          <p>
            Everything I said was valid until my 19 years, when I was in the first year of university I met a girl, it was love at first sight. 
            I have always been a very independent guy, and once the relationship got more and more serious the desire and interest in going to 
            live alone (actually with this girl) increased steadily.<br>
            From that moment on I began to understand the importance of having money aside to cover any expenses and to be able to afford to
            live alone, so I slowly began to search for notions about saving and managing money, and I discovered 
            the world of personal finance.<br>
            It fascinated me ever since, and in that moment I realized that all the mistakes I made in the past and the problems in preserving
            that were mainly related to the lack of a right motivation that pushed me to save money. 
            <b>But moving in with my girlfriend was a great driver.</b>

        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
          <h2>The Gold Rule</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "image_chapter_left" id = "gold_rule"></div>
          <p>
            One of the first things you discover when you approach the world of personal finance is <b>the 50-30-20 rule.</b><br>
            The fundamental principle is based on splitting your monthly income into three categories: 50% for needs,
            30% for wants and 20% for your savings goals or to pay off any debts.<br>
            Let's go deeper in this categories:
          </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
            <h3>50%: Needs</h3>
        </div>
          <p>
            Needs are those bills that you absolutely must pay and are the things necessary for <b><u>survival</u></b>.<br>
            These include rent or mortgage payments, car payments, groceries and insurance. 
            <b>Half of your income should be all that you need to cover your needs.</b>
            If you are spending more than that on your needs, you will have to either cut down on wants or try to downsize your lifestyle.
          </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
          <h3>30%: Wants</h3>
        </div>
          <p>
            Wants are all the things you spend money on that are <b><u>not absolutely essential.</u></b><br>
            This includes dinner and movies out and vacations. Anything in the "wants" bucket is optional.<br>
            Basically, wants are all <b>those little extras you spend money on that make life more enjoyable and entertaining</b>.
          </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
          <h3>20%: Savings</h3>
        </div>
          <p>
            Finally, try to allocate 20% of your income to savings and investments. This includes <b>adding money to an emergency fund 
            in a bank savings account or investing in the stock market</b>.<br>
            You should have at least four months of emergency savings on hand in case you lose your job or an unexpected unpleasant event occurs.
            After that, focus on the long period and meeting other financial goals down the road like <b>saving your first 10,000$ ;)</b>.
          </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
          <h2>My case</h2>
        </div>
          <p>
            All of the above applies to any person who lives alone or who has a family to mantain.<br>
            In my case, at that time I was not yet living alone, I didn't have to pay for real needs, so I decided to apply my own method, <b>50-50</b>:
            50% saved and 50% for wants, any amount that came in I would have divided them into this way!
          </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
            <h2>My firsts Earnings</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            At the time, I was studying at the University of Computer Science.<br>
            And between some chores at a tennis club and my father's alimony I was able to save about 200$ a month.
            With that step I would have saved 10,000$ in 20 months, so 1 year and 8 months, nothing to say in those who put it like this so much, but I wanted and could do better!<br>
            Fortunately, after a few months I managed to graduate in Computer Science (<a href="./graduating.html" target="_blank"><b><u>here</u></b></a> you can find the story),
            getting a degree like that was the best choice I had ever made. Being a software engineer in this historical period is an incredible and requested skill.<br>
            Within a week of my graduation I was already working in a company that paid me quite well for the effort it required of me.
            From that moment on I changed the 50:50 since 50% just for the whims would have been really too much, it turned more into an 80:20
            in favor of savings.
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
            <h2>It's just the Mindset</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "image_chapter_left" id = "mindset"></div>
        <p>
            With my precedent savings and the new job, it took me only other 5 months to save 10,000$.
            What I have learned is that: <b><u>the thing that matters most is the mindset with which you face certain goals
            and certain journey</u></b>, a figure that at this moment seems small to me seemed unattainable, but with the right mentality
            I managed to find the method to achieve the goal I had set for myself.
            And when I hit 10,000$, did I stop? Absolutely not, I started thinking about how to get to 100,000$.
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            So if I managed to do it, that I was never used to saving money, but actually loved spending on unuseful things,
            <b>I really think that anyone can do it.</b><br>
            Obviously, something has to take place that makes you start wanting to save money, you have to find the <b>right motivation</b>.
            Once you have found the motivation you just have to <b>apply the golden rule 50-30-20 as a starting point</b>,
            once you realize you can do better you'll see that you'll start saving much more money than you ever have imagined.
