          <br>
          In the past I have wondered many times why I should buy a mechanical keyboard. After all my membrane keyboard was working fine,
          it was no problem and it was cheap, what more did I want?
          Well, spending many hours on the computer to study and coding for various university projects,
          (read <a href="./graduating.html"  target="_blank"> <u><b>here</b></u></a> to find out more), at a certain point you start looking around, and you
           understand that the world of keyboards is so vast that
          you can't ignore it if you are someone like me who loves programming.
          </p>
        
      <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>Do I need a Mechanical Keyboard?</h2>
      </div>
        <p>
          This is the question I have asked myself most often since I discovered mechanical keyboards.<br>
          I was watching one video after another and I asked myself "Do I really need a mechanical keyboard?"
          My ears and my instincts said yes to hearing that splendid noise that your fingers generate when typing
          a letter on the keyboard, but mine wallet disagreed.<br>
          Unlike membrane keyboards, mechanical keyboards are notorious for being quite expensive, but it's also true that,
           like everything else, you find the ultra-affordable entry-level model that does the job without too much pretense.
          But if you really want to enter this world you have to spend some money, this is little but sure. Once I decided that
           I wanted to buy a mechanical keyboard, here is the huge dilemma.
      
       </p>


      <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>What Mechanical Keyboard I should buy?</h2>
      </div>    
        <p>
          The possibilities are endless, and the questions are even more:
        </p>
        <ul class="article_pointed_list">
          <a href="#first"><li>How much should I spend on a mechanical keyboard?</li></a>
          <a href="#second"><li>Which switches to choose?</li></a>
          <a href="#layout_image"><li>Which layout to choose?</li></a>
          <a href="#fourth"><li>Do I take it bluetooth or with the cable?</li></a>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <br>
          Let's try to answer:
          <br>
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
          <h3>How much should I spend on a mechanical keyboard?</h3>
        </div>    
       
          <p id = "first">
           Obvious answer: only you can know.<br>
           Honest answer: if it's your first mechanical keyboard, don't spend too much!<br> 
           The reason is very simple, you may not like to use a mechanical keyboard, I have many colleagues who hate mechanical keyboards, 
           they are really irritated by the noise that the keys make when they are pressed. Don't make the mistake of assuming you like the sound of the switches, it may not be.<br>
           So if you want a keyboard just to try the experience of a mechanic and not spend a lot, you could start with an entry-level model like mine, the <b>Kludge RK 61</b> (which you can find <a href="https://nz.banggood.com/Royal-Kludge-RK61-Mechanical-Keyboard-61-Keys-bluetooth-5_0-Wired-Dual-Mode-RGB-Gaming-Keyboard-p-1353613.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc_ods&utm_content=2nolan&utm_campaign=2nolan-sds-proline-mgk1-0412-all-1&ad_id=513916474031&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhf2MBhDNARIsAKXU5GR6Jc_0CQps6sO-NmczV2T4XtndJRki6tBy66VH8MsNhcLb3jrjqvUaAghtEALw_wcB&cur_warehouse=CN&ID=6287845515632"  target="_blank">
            <u><b>here</b></u></a>).
           I recommend this model because on the net there are many tutorials to mod it in every way, as I did and I will show in a next video on youtube.<br>
           Otherwise, if you feel convinced and want / can spend a little more to increase the quality of what you buy, you could opt for an <b>Anne Pro 2</b> (which you can find <a href="https://nz.banggood.com/Kailh-BOX-Switch-Anne-Pro-2-Mechanical-Keyboard-61-Keys-60-pencent-NKRO-bluetooth-4_0-Type-C-RGB-Gaming-Keyboard-p-1337351.html?cur_warehouse=CN&ID=6287830515630&rmmds=search"  target="_blank">
            <u><b>here</b></u></a>). <br>
           If you want to totally ignore my advice and start immediately from the top of the range I suggest you go to the <b>Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2</b>, this is not so easy to find, but it is truly the Ferrari of mechanical keyboards!

            <h3>Which switches to choose?</h3>
          </div>    
          
            <p  id = "second">
              This topic is really too vast to be able to adequately talk about it in this article, it would take another 10 articles just to cover this aspect.
              I find <a href="https://dygma.com/blogs/stories/the-ultimate-guide-to-mechanical-keyboard-switches-for-2020"  target="_blank">
              <u><b>this article</b></u></a> to be truly complete and exhaustive.<br>
              Suffice it to say that the switches for mechanical keyboards differ in three macro-classes:<br>
              <b>Linear:</b> they flow linearly without emitting a noise that gives pressure feedback.<br>
              <b>Clicky:</b> they emit a click that gives pressure feedback.<br>
              <b>Tactile:</b> they make a little more dull noise than the Clicky to give pressure feedback, these are undoubtedly my favorites.<br>
              Once we have chosen the type of switches we are interested in, we have to decide the necessary pressure for which the switch ends its stroke and the key is pressed,
              the lower this force is, the easier the key can be pressed. This is also a personal matter, I prefer a middle ground, neither too light nor too heavy. 
              Finally, we must also evaluate the activation point or at what moment of the stroke the switch is activated, obviously we are talking about millimeters such as 1.1mm (for a short stroke) or 2mm (for a long stroke).<br>
              All the features listed usually differ by color and manufacturer of the switches. Once you have done your calculations it is time to choose the brand of the switches:<br>
              Kaihl, Cherry Mx, Gateron etc...<br>
              The important thing is to have made the right considerations before, getting to choose the brand should be the last thing.
            </p>  
            
          <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
            <h3>Which layout to choose?</h3>
          </div>    
          <div class = "image_chapter_left" id = "layout_image"></div>
            <p  id = "third">
              Well if you are from the United States, the choice is trivial, take the U.S. layout.<br>
              In my humble opinion, even if many don't think like me, the best layout is the U.S. one. The reason is very simple: I am a programmer!<br>
              And programming is much smoother on the U.S. layout. Since all the most significant keys for programming are placed in easily reachable positions, such as the <b>;</b>. <br>
              I understand instead that for example for a writer of novels in the original language, other than English, it doesn't make much sense to take a layout other than your own.
              For example, I am Italian and there are no accented letters on my keyboard, a huge lack for a writer. In conclusion, you have to consider yourself whether to jump in and take a U.S. layout
              (which is present on most entry-level keyboards) or if you take the layout of your original language.

             <h3>Do I take it bluetooth or with the cable?</h3>
            </div>    
            <div class = "image_chapter_left" id = "bt_image"></div>
              <p  id = "fourth">
                This, perhaps, is the easiest question to answer, if you like being able to use your keyboard anywhere without fear of having cables around your desk then opt from the beginning on a bluetooth keyboard, perhaps with the possibility,
                however, of being attached with the cable, at least if the battery runs out you can continue to use it with a simple USB-C cable connected to the computer.<br>
                The only case in which I do not see only advantages in buying a bluetooth keyboard, is if you were a professional gamer for which a few thousand seconds of delay too much can make a difference, but I don't think this is the case!<br>
                Or at most you could choose a connection with the cable if you know that the keyboard is not used outside your workstation and you don't want to think about the battery charge and you don't mind having the cable in the middle of the desk.

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          So if you have red the whole article, you may have understood that a keyboard with U.S. layout, with tactile switches and bluetooth would be useful for you. Now you just have to search,
          as I recommended I would start from a cheap keyboard and at most if you see that you like this world you could improve it by starting to mod it by changing the keycaps, the switches and maybe lubricating it properly.<br>
          Or by reading this article you have understood that this world is too vast it does not attract you at all and you decide as far away as possible!<br>
          My advice is to try and throw yourself, you don't know what you're missing, trust me <b>;)</b>.<br>
          I will upload a video soon where I mod my keyboard to show you how I modded it, you'll find it on my <u><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn_9pgb-OehsLYkVyBpWmxA"  target="_blank">
