        If you've asked yourself such questions:<br>
        <b>â€œWhy am I always failing? Why is everyone able to do what they want but I can't? Why am I dissatisfied but I can't find the strength and the decision to change this situation?"</b><br>
        Well, you know you're not the only one, on the contrary... <br>

        The same story all the time...<br>
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>There are many good intentions:</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          I will start with 2 articles a week, 1 video a week plus 2 a month bonus if I can, I also upload daily stories on Instagram and 1 popular post a week and finally 1 tik tok a week which is now trendy, everything after 8 hours of work,
          one hour of aerobic training and one hour of anaerobic training. OK, I'm starting tomorrow!
          If I haven't uploaded anything to the blog / Instagram for 6 months, maybe the plan didn't work, maybe...<br>
  
          But this time, I have a really credible excuse! This time I can avoid feeling the blame! Perhaps...<br>

        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>The big news:</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "image_chapter_left" id = "fly_image"></div><br>
        <p>
          Well yes, the absence is mainly due to a reason: <b>I MOVED</b> <br>

          Exactly, a small step for humanity a big step for Gio. It was a long time that I wanted to go and live with my girlfriend, 
          and we finally found the courage and strength to throw ourselves and go live together. For many, making this move at 23 may seem too early,
          for others too late, I only can tell you that it is since I was a kid that I have been meant to take and go to live in another place for work. <br>
          Presented the opportunity I took the leap.<br>
          I always imagined that the first impact with such a thing would put me in a lot of difficulties, surprisingly, in a positive sense, it is absolutely
          not like how I figured this, but this is mainly due to my girlfriend, being in two, sharing the tasks does all much simpler and less boring.
          </p>
          <div class = "image_chapter_left" id = "routine_image"></div>
          <p><br>
          Obviously, in the beginning, I lost all the good habits I had built with time, training, reading etc...<br>
          I woke up, unpacked boxes, worked, arranged things, worked, unpacked boxes, and finally went to sleep this has been my life for a whole month.
          After this I started training a little again, first free body, slowly I started again to run and now I'm starting to get good habits, like working 
          for this project.
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>Feel good but don't be okay with yourself:</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          I was fine, I had just moved, the work in the company was fine, I had just received a raise, I spend my days with the girl I love,
          but I didn't feel at the top, I was happy but I felt inside me that something was wrong and I did not understand why, in the beginning... <br>
          Then I realized, it was so simple...<br>
          I felt incomplete, dissatisfied I had focused so much on these things and on enjoying the moment that I had
          completely let go of the project and the biggest initiative of my life: <b>JustG.io</b> was gone by the wayside.
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>Other route problems:</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "image_chapter_left" id = "problems_image"></div>
        <p>
          Ok, I understood what was not making me stay at the top, from that moment things had to change, so I sat there and analyzed the problem what made me forget and neglect the project did it have?
          After various reasoning I collected these main issues:<br>
          <ul class="pointed_list">
            <li class="pointed_list_li">
              <b>Indecision about the niche: </b><br>
                Exactly, I would sit there and think about the articles to write, posts to do, and videos to record, and each video had a topic detached from the other,
                I wanted to make technical videos, some funny and other about sports. Without one being attached to the other, those ideas were about something! 
                But not about me, not about <b><a target="_blak" href="www.justg.io">JustG.io</a></b>, and this completely clashed with the idea I have behind this project.
                So I went there and drew my conclusions on what I want to bring to my channels, if you still don't know you will find all the updated details on a
                future page of this blog.
            </li>
            <li class="pointed_list_li">
              <b>The ever green: "But I never have time":</b><br>
              Whenever I wondered why I didn't do anything for <b><a target="_blak" href="www.justg.io">JustG.io</a></b> I justified myself by saying that I didn't I had time to keep up
              with it,
              while in reality on the same day I went for a run, I watched 5 videos on youtube and a movie in the evening. The hard truth is that at that moment 
              I didn't have the will or the strength to start doing something as important as this. I still have to improve on this, but I'm working on it with all my heart!
            </li>
            <li class="pointed_list_li">
              <b>Shame:</b><br>
              I know it sounds weird, but I am ashamed, I am ashamed of my English, I am ashamed to expose myself even with my articles that No one will read except
              for my closest friends and my girlfriend. For "the English Problem" an article will arrive shortly.
            </li>
            <li class="pointed_list_li">
              <b>Pursuit of perfection:</b><br>
              This connects with the two points above, I am ashamed because I am afraid of being trivial, uninteresting and that what I write contains errors or is not beautiful or technically correct,
              I am always looking for the small detail while everything else is ignored, I have to constantly repeat the mantra <b>"Done is better than perfect"</b>.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>And now?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "image_chapter_left" id = "goals_image"></div>
      <p>
        First of all, the project will be based on the <b><a target="_blak" href="www.justg.io">JustG.io</a></b> Master Rules, I'll post an article about that! <br><br>

        Now I start again, with calm, tranquility, and a great desire to get involved, simply for my pleasure and pleasure of doing it.<br>
        Without any stringent and impractical editorial calendar for me!<br>
        An article comes out when it's ready, an Instagram post comes out when it's ready, no claims or obligations.<br>
        If you want to stay more updated on me and this project invite you to follow me on <u><b><a target="_blak" href="https://www.instagram.com/justgg.io/">my Instagram profile</a></b></u> where I try to be as active as possible and update you with the latest news.

        Thank you, thank you for reading these words, this outburst of mine, whoever you are, thank you for giving me this trust, I hope to repay you as soon as possible!
