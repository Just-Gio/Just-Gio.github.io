      <p>
      <br>
          I want to start again, and I want to do it great!

          In the previous article, which you find <a href="I_Always_Fail.html" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>, I wrote about the reasons why I did not continue with this project.

          Before the restart, however, and before that article, I started thinking about how to restart and with which rules. After thinking about it for a long time, here is the list of my goals and my new rules:
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>Personal Branding: What I want to do with JustG.io.</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          What I want to do with JustG.io, is to describe my journey to try to become a freelancer and to try to become the best version of myself, all accompanied by sympathy and sarcasm.
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>Rule 1: Never take yourself too seriously</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "image_chapter_left" id="serious_image"></div>
        <p>
          Although I fully believe in this project and in the possibility of becoming a freelancer, at the moment it is not even a source of income, it does not support me and I do not depend on this project, so joke about it and live it with all the tranquility and carefree of the world.
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>Rule 2: Always believe in it!</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Never give up, I want to do it and I have to remember it every day, even on the days when I'm exhausted because I worked for 8 hours and trained, every day I have to take an extra step towards the goal.
          Because tiredness or a difficult moment could momentarily distract me from the long-term goal that in those moments seems unattainable, it is precisely in those moments that I must have perseverance and dedication.
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>Rule 3: Share everything</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          This journey will be full of difficulties, unexpected events, and disappointments, well you will have to share all this and pass every aspect that involves you on this journey. 
          It's easy to show only the beautiful things, it will not be like this, you will share the problems you encounter, the difficulty of growing numerically to reach new audiences on Instagram, and the problem of finding time to work on your projects in your free time.
        </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
          <h2>Rule 4: Make it fuc*ing cinematic</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "image_chapter_left" id="cinematic_image"></div>
          <p>
            I think I have the skills to be able to create truly impactful content, and I would like it to be, if I register while running early in the morning or in the evening after work it must seem like a fuc*ing race of the world.
            This rule must not go against Rule 1, I have to do my utmost to get the best videos possible, but not to seek perfection because the first does not exist and the second I do not have the time to reach it right now.
            If I have content ready and done well, but not perfect, I don't give a fu*k and publish it!
          </p>
        <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
          <h2>Rule 5: Stay in the niche</h2>
        </div>
          <p>
            I would like to bring all kinds of content related to sports, programming, personal growth, and many other things.
            Actually right now I just have to try to bring content mainly about my journey.
            Avoid all the noise around and focus on personal growth and your goals.
          </p>
          <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          </div>
            <p>
              I don't know if within 2 weeks I'll give up again, but I'm really sure that I really want to keep moving with this project, It won't be absolutely easy 
              but I want it so <b>Go On!</b>
