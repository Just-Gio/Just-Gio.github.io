        <h2><br><br>The founder</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        <br>
        If you're wondering who the founder of Nike is, don't worry, I didn't even know who he was until a month ago.<br>
        His name is <b>Phil Knight</b>, in my opinion, an absolute genius and, like most geniuses, a man who is a bit crazy.<br>
        In this article, I will analyze what Phil taught me so that you too can get an idea of what can be learned from a person like him.<br>
        If you are wondering "<b>Gio</b> but how did you get the chance to be taught something by Phil Knight?", well, I tell you that anyone can learn something from him, since everything I write in this article I extrapolated from his book <b><u><a href="https://amzn.to/3bJ1pJL" target=”_blank”>Shoe Dog</b></u> (You can find it <b><u>here</u></b>)</a>.<br>
        I admit that I was skeptical, it was the first biography I read, and after the first few pages, I remember thinking “I'm afraid that biographies are not my thing”, I must say that after finishing the book I totally changed my mind. I can't wait to read more biographies of interesting people.
        In fact, in addition to having created one of the largest companies in the clothing industry in the last 40 years, he has also had a really fascinating life, which is why this reading was so pleasant, I will let you discover his personal life by reading the book if you’ll want: <b><u><a href="https://amzn.to/3bJ1pJL" target=”_blank”>Shoe Dog</b></u></a>.<br>
        
        Now let's move on to the lessons I learned from Phil Knight:
      </p>
      <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>Life is a Game</h2>
      </div>
      <div class = "image_chapter_left" id="fischio_image"></div>
      <p>
          <b><i>Whether we like it or not, life is a game. Whoever denies this truth, whoever refuses to play remains on the sidelines.</b></i><br>
          Well, this sentence is very provocative but it goes straight to the point. From my total ignorance and inexperience, I must say that I 100% share this view of life.<br>
          An important thing, however, is that in my opinion, it is wrong to think that: not getting involved is a mistake, in fact, there are simply those who want to live life in peace
          or simply have a completely different vision from mine or yours... <br>
          What is important in my opinion about this sentence is that life is a game and must be taken as such.
      </p>
      <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>Crazy Ideas</h2>
      </div>
      <div class = "image_chapter_left" id="crazy_ideas_image"></div>
      <p>
          <b><i>History is a long procession of crazy ideas.</b></i> <br>
          I had never seen history in this light, it is as simple as it is correct. If you think about it, any great step in human history is a consequence of a Crazy Idea,
          both the positive and negative turning points that have marked human history are consequences of Crazy Ideas.<br>
          From this quote, I want to retain the concept of: <b>not discarding in advance any idea just because it seems crazy to me.</b>
      </p>
      <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
          <b><i>You tell yourself that you are running towards a goal, that you are chasing some exhilarating sensation, but in reality, you are running because the alternative, stopping, scares you to death.</i></b><br>
          In the book, Phil Knight contextualizes many phrases or thoughts in sport, in particular in running since he has always been a great fan of this discipline.<br>
          I reflected a lot on this sentence, first of all as a running enthusiast I understood perfectly what he was referring to, secondly this sentence, in my opinion, I see it suitable for any context, for any passion or goal.<br>
          I don't even know if this is a good or bad thing, but I know for sure that the fear of stopping is because I am convinced with all my heart that it is worth continuing to run.
      </p>
      <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
        <h2>The Belief</h2>
      </div>
      <div class = "image_chapter_left" id="i_will_image"></div>
      <p>
          <b><i>The belief is irresistible.</i></b>
          Linked to the previous "teaching" I will treasure this phrase enormously.<br>
          Deep down I've always known that belief is an incredible driver and that it will eventually lead you where you want to go, but hearing it from people like Phil Knight can only make me believe it more.
      </p>
    <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
      <h2>Competition</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        <b><i>The art of competing is the art of forgetting, you have to forget your limits. You have to forget your doubts, your suffering, and your past. 
        You must forget that inner voice that cries and begs "Not one more step!". And if it is not possible to forget it, you have to come to terms with it.</i></b><br>
        If this quote weren't so long I would probably have it tattooed haha, at least I could read it at any time. I think it is difficult to find a sentence that best describes
        the competition with oneself, the competition with which I live every day, and with which I come to terms too often, but I will work on it, I <b>belive</b> I will succeed ;).
    </p>
    <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
      <h2>Taking Risks</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "image_chapter_left" id="risks_image"></div>
    <p>
      <b><i>It was worth a try. If his first company went bankrupt, he would be penniless, and it would be a blow. But he would have valuable lessons left that he could apply to his next company. 
        The teachings seem intangible, but they are still an asset, so it is worth taking the risks.<br>
      For this: Fail fast.</i></b><br>
      If it's worth it, take risks, whatever it is, take risks, better fail quickly and take advantage of the lessons learned than being stuck in a situation where you are 
      not happy or that makes you feel incomplete!
    </p>
    <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
      <h2>Stopping</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "image_chapter_left" id="stop_image"></div>
    <p>
      <b><i>Giving up doesn't mean stopping. Never Stop!</i></b>
      We must understand when to give up, when something is not right for us, when one thing is too much, and when something does not belong to us.
      But this does not mean stopping or abandoning one's projects and goals, no, absolutely not, never stop! On the contrary, understand what is wrong and continue towards our goal or,
      why not, change our goal if that's what we want.
    </p>
    <div class = "rotateElement" id = "divisor_chapter">
      <h2>His Experience and conclusions</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Below I simply write his quote, because adding any comment would be superfluous. Thank you for reading the article and I invite you to follow me on every other social network.<br>
      I highly recommend reading this book <b><u><a href="https://amzn.to/3bJ1pJL" target=”_blank”>Shoe Dog</b></u></a>, few books have marked and motivated me so deeply!<br>
      Here is the quote:<br>
      <b><i>
        I would like to share my experience, with all its ups and downs, so that young people who are experiencing the same trials and odyssey can feel inspired or comforted.
        Or warned. Perhaps some young entrepreneur, or perhaps an athlete, a painter or a writer, could be encouraged to hold on.<br>
        Because it is always the same motivation, the same dream.<br>
        It would be nice to help them avoid the classic discouragement. I would tell them to stop for a moment, to think long and hard about how they want to spend their time, 
        and with whom they would like to spend it in the next 40 years. I would tell those who are not yet 30 not to be satisfied with a job, a profession, or even a career.
        To seek a vocation. Even if they don't know what it means, they have to look for it. Following one's vocation, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will act as fuel,
        and they will experience satisfaction never experienced before.<br><br><br>
      </i></b>
