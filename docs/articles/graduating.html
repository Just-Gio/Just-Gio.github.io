        When I was a kid I hated going to school, I hated studying and even more I hated doing tests and homework, I never imagined I would graduate from university,
        much less going on at a rather difficult faculty. As a child I loved spending hours playing my favorite games on the PS2, while in reality I should have studied...<br>
        In fact, I approached the world of computer science, like almost everyone, thanks to the passion for video games, it happened in middle school when there was the generational leap
        between PS3 / PS4 and XBOX360 / XBOX ONE, I inquired on youtube and I realized that I would not have bought neither one nor the other but I would have preferred to assemble a computer
        to be able to play, from there a whole world opened up for me.<br>
        I started looking for processors, RAM and various components, in that moment I realized that a computer was capable of enormous things and this led me to a high school where I would have studied computer science,
        reluctantly after only the first year I realized that the computer science that I would see on that school would only be able to teach me to use excel (in a bad way) and the problem was
        always the same: I DID NOT WANT TO STUDY. <br>
        So I gritted my teeth for the first few years of high school just to try to graduate and got the fact that I would go to work once I got out of that school.
        </p>

        <h2>The revelation</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
        While I was in high school I worked to put some money in my pocket and take off some whims.
        Sometimes I worked in a tennis club, it was purely physical work, I had to fix the tennis courts between games, under the sun with rude customers;
        I perfectly remember the precise moment when I realized that I should have graduated:
        it was the 15th of August, in Italy it is almost considered a feast day, all my friends at 16/17-year-olds were all having fun on the beach, dancing or partying while I was there in the sun
        that I was "dying" of heat for the umpteenth time, at that moment I said to myself "I have to graduate to do what I want and not be forced to break my back".
        I would have passed to the fourth year of high school in September of that year, from then on I started to study a little more than in the past, but still nothing serious, while I inquired
        to find out what the computer science faculty was like and what I should have known to be able to graduate, there I discovered "MATHEMATICS", the serious one, the one that scares everyone.
        Everywhere I read "math is fundamental for computer science", "it's difficult" and discouraging things like that, I've always had a lot of self-esteem (maybe too much) and I said to myself
        "the others say, you will easily succeed" I don't think I've ever thought anything more stupid... <br>
        So I was decided! I would have enrolled in computer science, I would have studied, I would have understood everything and in a short time I would have graduated as easily.
        I finish high school graduating with 80, yes it's not that great but for how I started it was an incredible result, trust me.

        <h2>Not the best start</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
        From here on my university career begins, the first semester I clash with the big boss of this faculty MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS: the first lessons I thought "yes, mathematical functions, limits, there is!"
        I repeated to myself "if I study well at home I understand things and they stay in my head", but then I didn't study at home. <br>
        I don't think I made one of the best starts in university history, I studied very little, but a stroke of luck here and there, a bit of cunning and, perhaps, a bit "talent"
        At the end of the year I gave 3 exams out of 6, a bit suck but it was something, obviously I had passed all the "computer" exams and not all the mathematical ones: analysis,
        physics and linear algebra. <br>
        If I had continued like this I would have graduated in 6 years, a real crap, I had not at all entered the right mindset to face the university.

        <h2>The turning point</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
        One day, however, I realize that this was not going well, that I was wasting time, and I decide to roll up my sleeves, starting from the courses of the first year that I had not passed. 
        Going to class the first day I saw a guy I had met the year before,
        who told me to sit next to him and his two friends, I was not enthusiastic about the situation I wanted to leave alone so as not to have distractions from studying. <br>
        But I was wrong, I immediately got along well with this group, we began to follow the lessons and study together, they helped me a lot in mathematics, where I was most lacking,
        and incredibly I was able to take all the first year math exams. <br>
        I was always too far behind, I would never be able to graduate in time, I understood that I needed to accelerate, and so I did,
        in this case I don't know where I found the motivation but I know for sure that something had changed, start studying as much as possible , I managed to pass 10 exams in a year, with the pandemic underway in Italy due to the state of emergency they extended the duration of the academic years by a few months, and thanks to this extension and my perseverance I was incredibly able to graduate in time despite a departure disastrous.

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
       Ok let's get to the point, what can I teach you about the university? Little, but what I know is sacred in my opinion. <br>
        First: if you can, and have the right company, study in a group, the right minds together produce and work better, you can help each other in their respective gaps. <br>
        Second: do not underestimate the exams, do not think you can study little because "you are awake", it is not a question of being awake or smart, it is a question of knowing or knowing how to do things. <br>
        Third: take it with philosophy, and find the right motivation to go on and graduate, no one will do it for you, if you want that sheet of paper and that knowledge you have to make the deck.
        <br> <br>
        Finally, I would like to say that the university is not for everyone and it is not absolutely necessary, being a graduate does not make you a better or more intelligent person, it serves to certify that you are capable of studying and that, as a rule,
        you have a considerable amount of knowledge relating to the degree course. If you understand that university is not for you, don't waste your time!
        Find your way and your passions, you can do almost anything you want even without a degree, obviously if you want to become a doctor I'm sorry to disappoint you... but for example you can become the best programmer in the world even without a degree.
        I myself do not know if I would do the university again, do not get me wrong, I am happy to have done it, it opened my mind, opened many roads and made me understand many things that alone I would never have seen, but it took 3 years
        and half of my life in which maybe I could have learned to program very well on my own and started some personal projects more serious than those I have done.
        Even if I have this mentality now because I went to university, if I hadn't done it maybe I wouldn't have even been a programmer, who knows...
